# Project

The logistic regression tool offers a number of useful features, such as the ability to customize the cost function calculation using a manual logistic regression model with user-specified weights and bias values. The cost function uses log loss, and the cost value is recalculated based on user input parameters. The tool also supports automatic logistic regression model generation using `scikit-learn`, and allows users to visualize their data using `matplotlib`.
